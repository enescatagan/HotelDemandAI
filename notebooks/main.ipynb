    "**The objective** is to identify distinct customer segments based on their booking behavior, preferences, and characteristics. This segmentation will allow the business to tailor marketing strategies, optimize pricing, and improve customer satisfaction by addressing the needs of different groups more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How will be used?**<br>\n",
    "The solution will be used to:\n",
    "- Develop personalized marketing campaigns for different customer segments.\n",
    "- Adjust pricing strategies for high-value customers or price-sensitive groups.\n",
    "- Improve service offerings by catering to specific customer preferences.\n",
    "- Enhance overall customer experience and retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the current solutions:**<br>\n",
    "Currently, customer segmentation might be performed using basic filters or heuristics based on demographics or booking data. These approaches lack the depth of insights provided by data-driven clustering models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**System Design:**\n",
    "1. This is an **unsupervised learning** problem since there are no predefined labels or target outcomes. It will be solved offline, using historical data for clustering customers into segments.\n",
    "2. Models to test; `K-Means Clustering`, `Hierarchical Clustering`, `DBSCAN`, `Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)`, and similar Models\n",
    "3. Performance should be measured using clustering evaluation metrics such as:\n",
    "    - **Silhouette Score:** Measures how well-separated the clusters are.\n",
    "    - **Inertia (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares):** Measures compactness within clusters.\n",
    "    - **Business validation:** How actionable and interpretable the clusters are for the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimum performance needed to reach the business objective:**<br>\n",
    "The clusters should be:\n",
    "- Distinct and interpretable.\n",
    "- Actionable, enabling marketing or operational strategies to be developed.\n",
    "- Validated through business insights or pilot campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparable problems**\n",
    "- Market segmentation in retail or e-commerce.\n",
    "- Customer behavior analysis in travel and tourism. Experience with clustering techniques such as K-Means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering can be reused. Tools like Python's Scikit-learn, Pandas, and visualization libraries (e.g., Seaborn, Matplotlib) will be helpful."

    "**The objective** is to predict whether a customer will cancel a booking based on their booking behavior, preferences, and historical data. This will enable the hotel to reduce revenue loss, optimize resource allocation, and design effective customer retention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How will be used?**<br>\n",
    "The solution will be used to:\n",
    "- **Predict cancellations** in advance and prepare contingency plans.\n",
    "- **Improve revenue management** by forecasting demand accurately and minimizing overbooking risks.\n",
    "- **Tailor communication** with customers likely to cancel (e.g., send reminders or offer incentives to confirm their stay).\n",
    "- **Optimize staff scheduling and inventory allocation** to avoid wasted resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the current solutions:**<br>\n",
    "Currently, hotels may rely on manual analysis or basic rules of thumb (e.g., longer lead times or larger group bookings are more likely to cancel). These methods lack accuracy and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**System Design:**\n",
    "1. This is a **supervised learning** problem since we have labeled data (`IsCanceled`) to train the model. The problem will be solved offline using historical booking data, with periodic updates to the model as new data becomes available.\n",
    "2. Models to test; `Logistic Regression`, `Random Forest`, `Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)`, `Deep Learning (Neural Networks)` and similar Models\n",
    "3. Performance should be measured using classification metrics:\n",
    "    - **Accuracy:** Percentage of correct predictions.\n",
    "    - **Precision and Recall:** Especially for the \"cancellation\" class, since false positives and false negatives have different implications.\n",
    "    - **F1 Score:** Balances precision and recall.\n",
    "    - **ROC-AUC Score:** Evaluates the model's overall classification ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Minimum performance needed to reach the business objective:**<br>\n",
    "- **Recall:** At least 80% for identifying potential cancellations.\n",
    "- **Precision:** A reasonably high value to minimize unnecessary actions (e.g., overreacting to false positives).\n",
    "- **Overall Accuracy:** 70%-80% or higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparable problems**\n",
    "- Churn prediction in telecom or e-commerce.\n",
    "- Fraud detection in banking. Experience with binary classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting can be reused. Tools like Python’s Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and TensorFlow are applicable."

    "**The objective** is to dynamically adjust room prices based on demand, customer preferences, and market trends to maximize revenue while maintaining competitive pricing. This approach will help the hotel optimize occupancy rates and revenue per available room (RevPAR).\n",
    "\n",
    "**How will be used?**<br>\n",
    "The solution will be integrated into the hotel’s pricing strategy and used to:\n",
    "- Automatically recommend optimal room rates based on real-time data.\n",
    "- Respond to changes in demand, seasonality, and market conditions.\n",

    "**What are the current solutions:**<br>\n",
    "Current solutions may include:\n",
    "- Fixed seasonal pricing, which lacks flexibility.\n",
    "- Manual adjustments based on intuition or historical data, which are time-consuming and less accurate.\n",
    "- Third-party revenue management systems, which may not be customized for the hotel’s unique needs.\n",

    "    - **Occupancy Rate:** Percentage of rooms sold.\n",
    "    - **Model Accuracy:** Predictive accuracy for optimal price suggestions.\n",
    "    - **Comparison with Baseline:** Revenue improvement compared to current static pricing strategies.\n",
    "    - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**The average of the difference between actual and forecast prices.\n",
    "    - **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** It is more sensitive to larger errors.\n",

    "**Minimum performance needed to reach the business objective:**\n",
    "- A measurable increase in RevPAR compared to the existing pricing strategy (e.g., a 10%-20% improvement).\n",
    "- Maintaining or increasing the occupancy rate without significant customer dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparable problems**\n",
    "- Dynamic pricing in airlines and e-commerce.\n",
    "- Yield management in car rentals and event ticketing. Tools and techniques used for demand forecasting, time series analysis, and reinforcement learning can be adapted for this problem."
